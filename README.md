# Python-Game
This is a 2 player game built with Phosphor. The goal is simple but fast paced:  An object appears randomly on the screen.  Both players race to reach it.  When a player touches the object, they earn 1 point, and the object instantly relocates to a new random position.  The game continues as players compete to collect as many points as possible.
